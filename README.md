# FreeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page Project

This project is my entry for the Free Code Camp technical documentation page project, part of the responsive web design curriculum. It features ths basics of HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on mobile first development. It also incorporates the concept of modularization for the CSS code, and the use of an external JavaScript library - Hilight.js.
